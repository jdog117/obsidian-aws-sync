# Obsidian cloud storage and syncing
This is an Obsidian plugin I am developing which automatically saves all vault files to the cloud (AWS S3) and handles syncing across devices.

### Features to be implemented
- Use SNS, lambda, or another solution to auto notify/sync other divices when current device updates files in s3
